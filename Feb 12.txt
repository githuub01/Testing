                         Route Parameters
- Route Parameter is configured for routes, so that they can query and render any content within a component.

- Route parameter is configured in route path.

        <Route  path="name/:param1/:param2"   element={ } />

- Values into parameters are passed from address bar of browser

        http://localhost:3000/name/val1/val2

- React components can collect the route parameters using a hook  "useParams()".

- "useParams()" returns an object with key-value pair.

        {
          param1: val1,
          param2: val2
        }
